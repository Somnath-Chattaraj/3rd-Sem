-- 2. Add the Enrollment Date Field to the Enrollment Table

ALTER TABLE Enrollment 
ADD ENROLL_DATE DATE;

-- 3. Add a Not Null Constraint to Course Name

ALTER TABLE Course 
MODIFY CourseName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;

-- 4. Find the Course Which Has More Than 3 Students

SELECT CourseID, CourseName 
FROM Course
WHERE CourseID IN (
    SELECT CourseID 
    FROM Enrollment 
    GROUP BY CourseID 
    HAVING COUNT(StudentID) > 3
);

-- 5. Give the Details of a Student with All Subjects and Grades (Given StudentID as Input)

SELECT S.StudentName, C.CourseName, SB.SubjectName, MG.Grade
FROM Student S
JOIN Enrollment E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
JOIN MarksGrade MG ON E.StudentID = MG.StudentID AND E.CourseID = MG.CourseID
JOIN Subject SB ON MG.SubjectID = SB.SubjectID
JOIN Course C ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID
WHERE S.StudentID = <input_student_id>;
Replace <input_student_id> with the specific StudentID value.

-- 6. Display the Course Where the Maximum Number of Students Enrolls

SELECT CourseID, CourseName 
FROM Course 
WHERE CourseID = (
    SELECT CourseID 
    FROM Enrollment 
    GROUP BY CourseID 
    ORDER BY COUNT(StudentID) DESC 
    LIMIT 1
);

-- 7. Find Out the Course Where No Student is Enrolled

SELECT CourseID, CourseName 
FROM Course 
WHERE CourseID NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT CourseID 
    FROM Enrollment
);

-- 8. Delete Course No 30 from the Course Table

DELETE FROM Course 
WHERE CourseID = 30;

-- 9. Rename the Course Table as Department

ALTER TABLE Course 
RENAME TO Department;

-- 10. Change the Marks Grade of Student “A” to “B” Who is Enrolled in the Subject DBMS. Assuming "DBMS" refers to a subject, you would first need to ensure the subject ID is known:

UPDATE MarksGrade 
SET Grade = 'B' 
WHERE Grade = 'A' 
AND SubjectID = (SELECT SubjectID FROM Subject WHERE SubjectName = 'DBMS');

-- 11. Delete the Record of the Student Who is Enrolled in the Course 'IT'

DELETE FROM Student 
WHERE StudentID IN (
    SELECT StudentID 
    FROM Enrollment 
    WHERE CourseID = (SELECT CourseID FROM Course WHERE CourseName = 'Information Technology')
);

-- 12. Change the Enroll Date to ‘16-08-2018’ Where Student ID is 18069. Convert the date to the default YYYY-MM-DD format:

UPDATE Enrollment 
SET EnrollmentDate = '2018-08-16' 
WHERE StudentID = 18069;
