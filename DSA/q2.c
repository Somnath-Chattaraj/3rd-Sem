// A simple structure SavingsAccount for savings account used in banks as follows: Each SavingsAccount
// structure variable should have three data members to store the account holderâ€™s name, unique account
// number and balance of the account. Assume account numbers are integers and generated sequentially. Note
// that once an account number is allocated to an account, it does not change during the entire operational
// period of the account. The bank also specifies a rate of interest for all savings accounts created. Write
// relevant methods (such as withdraw, deposit etc.). The bank restricts that each account must have a
// minimum balance of Rs. 1000. Now create 100 SavingsAccount variable specifying balance at random
// ranging from Rs. 1,000 to 1,00,000. Now, calculate the interest for one year to be paid to each account and
// deposit the interest to the corresponding balance. Also find out total amount of interest to be paid to all
// accounts in one year. (Note: create at least 10 accounts for smooth operation)
